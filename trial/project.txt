At a time when the world is suffering from a deadly pandemic, India
plans to convert this crisis into an opportunity and strengthen its fight by
becoming Aatmanirbhar or self-reliant.
The term was coined by the Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi
during his address to the nation on May 12, 2020. He called this campaign
as Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan (Self- Reliant India Movement).
 He also
defined five pillars of Aatmanirbhar Bharat – Economy, Infrastructure,
System, Demography and Demand. He stressed that it is time to become
vocal for our local products and make them global.1xx` Under this campaign, a
special economic package has been released by the government, 
which will
benefit various segments including cottage industry, Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), labourers, middle class, and industries,
among others.
PM Modi’s five pillars of making India self-reliant
Economy: We have to bring an economy that doesn’t bring incremental
change but quantum jump.
Infrastructure: We need an infrastructure which can become the identity of
modern India.
System: A system that doesn’t follow norms of the previous century. It
should be able to fulfill our 21st century dreams and be technology driven.
Vibrant Democracy: It is our strength, it is the source of energy for our
dream to make India self-reliant.
Demand: The demand-supply chain is our power
